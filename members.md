		Post-Doctoral Research Associate <br>
		<p style="color:black;font-size:16px;">Arya is a research associate in Centre for autonomous robotics at the University of Bath. In 2021, I was awarded with the PhD degree in robotics and automatic control by polytechnic university of Catalonia. I conducted my PhD research in the institute of robotics and industrial informatics where I was a doctoral researcher in KYNODIN project funded by Spanish council for scientific research (CSIC). Before starting my PhD, I was a researcher in Iran neural technology centre for about two years. I received my MSc in mechatronics from university of Tehran in 2016. I was a research member of sport medicine and mechatronics lab at university of Tehran. In 2008, I obtained my BEng in electrical engineering from Azad university of Tehran. My research interests cover diverse topics in the area of robotics and biomechatronics due to my experiences in various disciplines. Particularly I focus on human-integrated robotic systems, AI based neural interfaces, soft wearable devices, kinematics and design and interval-based analysis. I have designed, fabricated and rendered handful of robots mostly for research purposes and also developed plenty of packages for kinematics of industrial manipulators in C++ and ROS. </p>
